<p>The Leonardogroup@work platform is an online service allowing its Users to be informed of potential risks and/or vulnerabilities in terms of computer security that may affect their computer systems or networks. As specified below, the Leonardogroup@work platform does not perform a vulnerability analysis of Your Network, but only (i) checks the Databases to see if Your IP address or Your Domain appears one or more times, and (ii) informs You if Your IP address Network or Your Domain appears in one or more of these Databases. The Leonardogroup@work platform is available for free.</p>

<h3>3.2. Register Your Network and Domain</h3>

<p>In order to use the Leonardogroup@work platform, you must authenticate yourself on the Leonardogroup@work online platform. After successful authentication, You will be asked to register Your Network and Your Domain. To ensure that You have the necessary authorization and rights to register the network and domain and receive Alerts for your Network and Domain, You must authenticate yourself.</p>

<h3>3.3. Specific Alerts for Your Network and Your Domain</h3>

<p>Once you have successfully registered Your Network or Your Domain, the Leonardogroup@work platform registers Your Network or Your Domain and sends it to the backend where your IP address and the infected IP addresses can be compared. If Your IP address matches an infected IP address in the Database, You will be sent a message to Your e-mail address. If your IP address changes, the Leonardogroup@work platform will register your new IP address and send it to the backend.</p>

<h4>When does a user receive an alert?</h4>

<p>You will receive an Alert if Your IP address appears in one of the Databases and provided that the Leonardogroup@work platform has not previously notified You of the Threat.<br>
You will not receive an alert in the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Scenario 1: Your IP address does not appear in any of the Databases.</li>
	<li>Scenario 2: Your IP address appears in one of the Databases but the Leonardogroup@work&nbsp; platform has already notified you of the Threat</li>
	<li>Scenario 3: You have deactivated the Alert reception functionality in the Leonardogroup@work platform.</li>
	<li>Scenario 4: You have a dynamic IP address and your new IP address is not yet registered in the Leonardogroup@work platform and in the backend. Every time the Leonardogroup@work platform is opened, it checks if your current IP address still matches the registered IP address. If this is not the case, the Leonardogroup@work platform records Your current IP address.</li>

This restriction includes any attempt to integrate any information from the Leonardogroup@work platform into any other directory, product or service.<br>
If you are no longer the owner of Your Network or Your Domain or if the owner of Your Network or Your Domain revokes his or her consent to receive Alerts related to Your Network or Your Domain, you agree to modify the information provided on the Leonardogroup@work platform or you will immediately notify the CCB in order to deregister Your Network or Your Domain from the Leonardogroup@work platform and terminate this Agreement.</p>

<h3>4.2. The CCB's obligations</h3>

This includes natural disasters, the commencement or escalation of hostilities (whether a war has been declared or not), hacking or cyber attacks that cannot be prevented by reasonable security measures, or any other illegal act perpetrated against public order or the authorities, unforeseen actions by the authorities, a strike or any other professional conflict, government restrictions, disruptions to electricity or communications, and the suspension of payments, the insolvency, impounding, administration, bankruptcy or liquidation of any third party;</li>
	<li>negligent, illegal, unethical, fraudulent or criminal acts or omissions of any third party;</li>
	<li>hacking and/or the spread of computer viruses, bugs or any other malicious software, malfunctions or errors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Limitation of liability</h4>

<p>Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall the CCB or its subcontractors be liable for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Any loss including, but not limited to, loss of or damage to goodwill, loss of data, lost profits, business disruption, third party claims, lost reputation or anticipated savings, even if the CCB was advised or otherwise knew or should have known of the possibility or likelihood of such losses, and regardless of whether the action is in contract or tort (including negligence) or otherwise, and regardless of whether any limited remedy provided herein is determined to be lacking in its essential purpose;</li>
	<li>Any direct damage other than that caused exclusively by the intentional fault of the CCB, except in the case of death or bodily injury.</li>
</ul>

<p>This chapter applies, notwithstanding the legal basis or nature of the request.</p></div>

<p>While the CCB makes reasonable effort to ensure that all information and documentation relating to the Leonardogroup@work platform is correct, this does not constitute a warranty and neither the CCB nor its subcontractors are liable for or guarantee the accuracy, completeness or authenticity<br>
of the information.</p>

<p>The Leonardogroup@work platform and its services are provided "as is". All guarantees, either express or implied, are hereby disclaimed, including guarantees of merchantability, title/non-infringement, quality of information or fitness for a particular purpose. No information obtained by You from the CCB or its subcontractors shall constitute a guarantee not expressly stated herein. Without limitation and to the extent legally possible, the CCB and its subcontractors make no guarantee as to the availability of the Leonardogroup@work platform or associated products and services, except as expressly stated in the Agreement, or, with respect to error-free operation, that defects will be corrected or that the products or services are free of viruses or other harmful components. You use the Leonardogroup@work platform at Your own risk, any content obtained through the Leonardogroup@work platform is provided at Your own risk, and You are solely responsible for any damage to Your computer system that may result from the use of the Leonardogroup@work platform, including, without limitation, damage resulting from computer viruses.</p>

<h3>9.2. Specific guarantee exclusion</h3>

<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the CCB, including its subcontractors, disclaims<br>
any guarantee for the following:</p>

<h4>No guarantee of the error-free operation of the Leonardogroup@work platform</h4>

<p>The CCB cannot guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Leonardogroup@work platform. The Leonardogroup@work platform may be slowed, unavailable or inaccurate from time to time due to a variety of factors, including location, internet connection speed, technical reasons, maintenance or updates.</p>

<h4>No guarantee as to the accuracy of the Alerts or third party content</h4>

<p>You understand that any information provided to you as part of an Alert comes from databases provided by third parties. Accordingly, the CCB makes no guarantee and assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of these Alerts or your use of the information contained in these<br>
Alerts.</p>

<p>More generally, the Leonardogroup@work platform may contain third party content and links to other websites that are completely independent of the CCB. Third party content and links are provided solely as a convenience to users and do not constitute an endorsement, approval or guarantee by the CCB. Therefore, the CCB is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness or reliability of any information provided by third parties, nor for any products or services offered or sold through any linked website. In this regard, you assume full responsibility for the use of third party information.</p>

<h4>No responsibility for recommendations provided by the Leonardogroup@work platform or the CCB</h4>

<p>In order to allow you to improve the security of Your Network and Your Domain, the Leonardogroup@work platform or the CCB website may provide you with information on how the security of Your Network and Your Domain could be improved or how the threat indicated in the Alert could be addressed. You understand, however, that the information provided is generic information that is often provided by third parties. The CCB therefore assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of this information or for any damages resulting from the use of this information.</p>

<p>In addition, the CCB does not guarantee that implementing the instructions provided in this information will eliminate the security threat identified by the Alert in question.</p></div>
